/* Minimal CSS Reset */

/* It's good practice to have a root font size and box-sizing */
/* These are already in GlobalStyles.js, but keeping them here as a fallback or for non-styled-component parts won't hurt. */
/* However, to strictly follow the "avoid conflicts" and "GlobalStyles.js handles it" principle, we can remove them too. */

/* For this task, let's make it very minimal, assuming GlobalStyles.js handles everything. */

/* If there were any crucial CSS variables for JS interop not related to theming, they could stay. */
/* In this case, there are none. */

/* Remove all default Vite styles and theme-specific styles previously here. */
/* GlobalStyles.js will now manage fonts, body background/color, etc. */
